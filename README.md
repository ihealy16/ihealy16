### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ivan and I'm currently a Project Manager. I'm a huge proponent of personal growth so I love constantly taking on the challenges that come with learning new skills. As of late, I've taken on the task of teaching myself how to code and since beginning my journey, I've learned so much with all the educational resources available at our finger tips! My favorite part is watching an idea come to life all as the code forms in the background.
